        The Smoke I Never Inhaled

        In 1972, a college professor named George Murphy got the idea of building a community centre with an Olympic pool, a soccer turf, and other fitness facilities along with a vast “ASPHALT GREEN’ sign slapped onto a rejuvenated Municipal Asphalt Plant building.
        Asphalt Green is my Goldilocks; it’s just right. It’s got the older women doing their water aerobics with 80s music in the background and the fifty-plus teenagers singing along underwater during a killer set - “EYE OF A TIGERRRRR” - with bubbles coming out from the
        side of their mouths. It’s got the yoga classes I’d see when I pass by on my way to practice that make me say to myself, “Dammn, I wish I could do that right now.” I remember the first time I
        stepped onto the Asphalt Green campus. First, it was the synthetic green and white soccer field; then, it was the pathway with the heavy metal doors at its rear and a playground with screaming 8-year-olds to its left. Soccer field - pathway - playground - steel door
        is the sequence that lives in the back of my mind for the next two years. When I opened the door, a gush of wind decided to abruptly slap me in the face, carrying the strong smell of chlorine. Ignore all the other fancy things in front of me; this smell was what encouraged
        me to step into the room because it was the familiar scent I had engulfed myself in for the last 13 years.
